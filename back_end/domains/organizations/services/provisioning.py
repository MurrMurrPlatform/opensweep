"""Org membership provisioning — the write side of multi-tenancy.

First OIDC login of an unknown user:
  - a pending OrgInvitation matching their email (case-insensitive) attaches
    them to the inviting org with the invited role, or
  - a personal org is created and they become its owner (org_role=owner,
    role=admin, onboarded=False so the frontend runs the welcome flow).

Already-registered users can accept later invitations explicitly
(accept_invitation) — they move orgs, and their previous org is deleted when
it ends up empty (no members, no repositories).

migrate_tenancy() runs on every backend startup and is idempotent: it only
touches users whose org_uid is unset (pre-membership deployments carried the
Zitadel org in idp_org_id), repairs owner-less orgs, ensures the local org
node exists, and backfills GitConnection links from repositories that
already reference an installation. First and repeat deploys converge to the
same state.
