"""Campaign planning — pure partition + part-list math, no DB.

`normalize_areas` partitions the repository's real file tree across the
docs' watch scopes under one invariant — EVERY FILE IS OWNED BY EXACTLY
ONE AREA, the doc page with the most specific matching watch prefix —
then right-sizes the result (split oversized, merge tiny same-branch,
sweep uncovered paths into a remainder area). `build_plan` turns areas +
lenses into the campaign's part list per template. Both are pure so the
whole planning surface is unit-testable; campaign_service supplies the
loaded docs/tree/lenses.
