"""Campaign lifecycle: create (plan), launch, cancel, read.

Planning loads the repository, its docs, the live file tree, and the lens
catalog, then hands the pure planner the partition work. Tree resolution
degrades to watch-path-only areas on ANY failure — planning never fails
because GitHub was unreachable. Status only moves through the legality
matrix; every mutation appends a timeline event with the same
refetch-before-save discipline as thread_service.record_event.
