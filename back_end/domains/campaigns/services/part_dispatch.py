"""Dispatch one campaign part as a Run.

Area parts mirror sweep.run_audit's compose+trigger call: the seeded "ask"
base is the instructions layer, and the code-owned structural slot carries
the scope contract, the rendered lens checklist, and the coverage
reporting contract (complete_run's covered/skipped/lens_verdicts). Feature
parts are area parts with the Area's spec inlined as the contract to
verify (implementation-gaps lens). Global parts dispatch the lens's seeded
variant Agent with a digest of the `escalate:<lens-key>` findings the area
runs filed for it.
