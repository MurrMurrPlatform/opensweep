"""Campaign finalize: fold the parts' outcomes into one digest.

`build_summary` is pure (counts + coverage + holes); `finalize_campaign`
loads each part's findings (source_run_uid / source_run_uids match) and
Checked coverage stamps, saves the summary, and closes the campaign —
done, or failed when EVERY part failed. Idempotent: the tick re-runs it
for rows stranded in finalizing by a crash.
