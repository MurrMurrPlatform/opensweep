"""Campaign — the discovery-side Thread: one whole-repo audit effort.

A Campaign partitions a repository into bounded area runs (docs' watch
paths sized against the real file tree) plus global sweeps for the
cross-cutting lenses, dispatches them a few at a time, tracks coverage
per part, and finalizes into one digest. It orchestrates and references
Runs; it never replaces them. Status only ever moves through the service
so every move is legality-checked and audited (mirrors threads/models.py).
