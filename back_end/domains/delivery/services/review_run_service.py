"""Review-run — read-only PR review ending in a SHA-bound verdict (§6).

V3: a review is a Run with playbook=review whose first-turn intent instructs
the executor to review the PR diff, file findings through the platform
tools, bind them to the PR, verify fixed claims, and finish with
submit_verdict at the exact head SHA it inspected. Quota exhaustion or an
unavailable head never fakes a verdict — the fallback is needs_human.
