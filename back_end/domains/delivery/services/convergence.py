"""Convergence predicate — pure functions, no I/O (PLATFORM_V2_DESIGN.md §5).

A PullRequest is CONVERGED iff, all evaluated at head_sha:
  1. CI green, strictly: rollup non-empty, all concluded, zero failures.
  2. Fresh verdict: latest verdict sha == head_sha and result == approve.
  3. Clean round: that verdict raised zero new blocking findings (when the
     MergePolicy requires a clean round).
  4. Ledger clear: zero blocking-capable resolutions that the policy (or a
     human override) marks blocking. Deferred and waived never block.

Everything here takes plain data in and returns plain data out so the
predicate is unit-testable without Neo4j or GitHub.
