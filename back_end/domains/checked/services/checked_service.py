"""Checked stamps: record audit coverage on run completion.

record_for_run replaces CoverageService.record_for_run — one stamp per scope
the run touched, no concern dimension. Scopes are Doc uids (or the
repository uid). Checked stamps are audit-COVERAGE history (when/at-what-
revision/with-what-outcome a scope was last looked at), NOT a freshness
signal: staleness is the single derived review axis on the Doc/Area
(code_changed_at > last_reviewed_at). `audit_coverage` exposes the per-scope
latest stamp; it deliberately does not derive any "changed since" flag.
