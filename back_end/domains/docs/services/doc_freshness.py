"""Doc freshness — webhook-driven (KNOWLEDGE_V3_DOCUMENTATION.md §9).

GitHub-only: there is no local working copy whose mtimes can be walked.
GitHub `push` webhooks hand us the changed paths from the payload
(commits[*].added/modified/removed) and we mark the Doc pages watching them
stale — see api/v1/github_webhooks.py.

The unified freshness model: a page is STALE when it needs review — code
moved under its watch_paths since the last review (code_changed_at >
last_reviewed_at, derived, never stored). Stale clears ONLY when the page is
reviewed: a human edit, an accepted DocEdit, or an explicit
confirm_doc_current from a document run that verified the page and found it
still true. Checked stamps are audit-coverage history, not freshness — a
code-quality audit does not clear docs-stale. No LLM is involved here — pure
path matching (domains/repositories/services/path_matching.py).
