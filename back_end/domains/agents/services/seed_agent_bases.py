"""Seeded per-key system base Agents — the *task instructions* layer.

One enabled system Agent per key, identified by provenance="system" +
source_url="opensweep://agent/<key>". These bodies are the editable task
instructions of each agent — the layer an org override appends to (or, in
replace mode, substitutes). They were extracted from the per-playbook
default-intent code constants; everything structural (checkout steps, ledger
calls, verdict rules, write-gate rules, framing header, look-before-write
footer) stays in code and composes around them (see
domains/agents/services/composition.py).

Same seeding contract as the workflow stage defaults (seed_defaults.py):
idempotent, `seed_checksum` roll-forward — untouched rows get shipped
improvements on SYNC, admin-edited rows are never clobbered. When a base row
is deleted or disabled, composition falls back to the in-code copy of the
same body (`agent_base_fallback`), so a run never loses its instructions.
