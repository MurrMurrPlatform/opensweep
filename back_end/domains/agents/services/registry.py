"""System-agent registry: keys, produces↔playbook mapping, stage mapping.

The single place that translates between the user-facing Agent vocabulary
(`produces`) and the internal run machinery (`playbook`, workflow stage).

System agents are identified by a stable `source_url`; `agent_key` derives
the short key exposed to the UI and used throughout dispatch:

    opensweep://agent/<key>        → <key>            (playbook bases)
    opensweep://workflow/<stage>   → <stage>-guidance (stage guidance defaults)
    opensweep://library/<slug>     → <slug>           (strategy variants)
