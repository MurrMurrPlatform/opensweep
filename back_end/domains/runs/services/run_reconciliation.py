"""Repair for orphaned/stuck Runs — the persisted row must never lie forever.

Dispatch is an in-process asyncio task (the FastAPI backend for API
dispatches, a Celery worker for schedule ticks and quota resumes). If that
process restarts or crashes mid-run, nothing is left to move the row out of
`queued`/`running`. Two repair paths:

  - reconcile_orphaned_runs — startup sweep: the restarting process
    immediately fails the runs it owned (usage["dispatch_runtime"]).
  - reconcile_stale_runs — periodic (beat tick) + lazy (read endpoints and
    the in-flight 409 guard): liveness first — the transcript stream going
    silent covers EVERY provider kind, including local ones that have no
    wall ceiling — then the wall ceiling for metered kinds.
