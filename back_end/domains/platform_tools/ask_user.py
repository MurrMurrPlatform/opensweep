"""Platform tool: ask_user.

The thread session agent asks the user a STRUCTURED question instead of
burying it in prose: the question (plus optional multiple-choice options)
lands on the thread as a `question` event, the thread UI renders it as an
answer card, and the user's answer resumes the conversation as a normal
follow-up turn. Distinct from `ask_question` (deep-scan Analysis surface).
