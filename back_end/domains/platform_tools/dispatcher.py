"""Platform-tool dispatcher.

Single in-process entry point for executors that wish to invoke any of
the tracking-safe platform tools by name. Used by:
- the HTTP transport (`api/v1/platform_tools.py`) for non-Python executors
- the `internal_llm` adapter to call tools synchronously
- the MCP bridge in the `claude_code` adapter to route MCP tool calls

Each registry entry carries a one-line description used by the executor
prompt kit (`domains/executors/prompt_kit.py`) to render tool lists — the
registry is the single source, so prompts can never drift from the surface.
