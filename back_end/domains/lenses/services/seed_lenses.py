"""Seeded audit lenses — the platform's decomposed audit vocabulary.

The bodies decompose the monolithic audit prose of the seeded variants
(seed_variants.py: deep-issue-hunt, security-audit, review-adversarial)
into per-discipline snippets an area run can work one at a time. Each body
is standalone: what to check, what evidence a finding needs, and that
"checked, nothing found" is a valid verdict — the lens_verdicts contract
depends on agents saying so instead of padding.

Upsert semantics are byte-for-byte the prompt library's
(platform_prompts.upsert_platform_prompt): platform-owned fields are hashed
into `seed_checksum`, SYNC rolls forward provably untouched rows only,
FORCE resets everything, UPSERT never touches an existing row.
