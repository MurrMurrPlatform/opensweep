"""Area freshness — webhook-driven, the Doc freshness flow ported to the
Area map.

GitHub `push` webhooks hand us the changed paths from the payload and we
mark the Areas whose scope_paths cover them stale — same entry point as
Doc pages (domains/agents/services/event_triggers.refresh_docs_for_change).

The unified freshness model: an area is STALE when it needs review — code
moved under its scope_paths since the last review (code_changed_at >
last_reviewed_at, derived, never stored). Stale clears ONLY when the area is
reviewed: a human edit, an accepted AreaEdit, or an explicit
confirm_area_current from a map/document run that verified the area is still
correctly partitioned. Checked stamps are audit-coverage history, not
freshness — a code-quality audit does not clear area-stale. No LLM is
involved here — pure path matching
(domains/repositories/services/path_matching.py).
