"""Seeded workflow-default prompts — OpenSweep's own guidance, in the library.

One enabled AgentPrompt per workflow stage, identified by
source="platform" + source_url="opensweep://workflow/<stage>". These are the
prompts a repository's workflow config resolves to when the user hasn't
picked one, so the *default guidance for every run type is itself a
prompt-library entry* — editable, replaceable, disableable like any other.

The structural contract of each run (checkout steps, ledger calls, verdict
rules, write-gate rules) stays in code; these bodies carry only the
judgment guidance appended to it (or, for ask/discover, the intent body).

Seeding is idempotent and never overwrites: an existing row for a stage is
left exactly as the user last edited it.
