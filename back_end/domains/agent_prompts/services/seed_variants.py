"""Seeded prompt variants — alternative per-stage strategies in the library.

Where seed_defaults.py provides THE default prompt per workflow stage
(opensweep://workflow/<stage>), this module seeds named variants of those
stages under opensweep://library/<slug>: different recall/precision trade-offs
(deep-issue-hunt vs quick-scan), different lenses (security-audit), and
different disciplines (fix-root-cause, implement-tdd). A repository's
workflow config can point any stage at any of these, so teams can compare
which strategy performs best per repo.

Prompt-writing ground rules baked into these bodies (distilled from
anthropics/claude-code-security-review, obra/superpowers, and the
SkillLens meta-skill rubric — arXiv:2605.23899):

- Encode the failure mechanism (why things go wrong), not just a checklist.
- Actionable specificity over platitudes; severity by definition, not label.
- Explicit do-NOT-file exclusions and stop conditions; precision and recall
  are a dial, and each variant states which way it is turned.

Seeding is idempotent and never overwrites a user-edited row.
