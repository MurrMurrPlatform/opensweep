"""Allowlist env builder for agent CLI subprocesses (§6, §13).

Agent CLIs run with `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` inside sandbox
clones — anything in their environment is readable by the code they execute.
The platform process, however, holds real secrets (NEO4J_PASSWORD,
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET, OPENSWEEP_AUTH_TOKEN, GITHUB_TOKEN, …), so copying
os.environ and stripping known-bad names is the wrong default: every new
platform secret would leak until someone remembers to add it to the strip
list. Instead the agent env is built from an explicit ALLOWLIST plus the
credentials each executor deliberately passes.
