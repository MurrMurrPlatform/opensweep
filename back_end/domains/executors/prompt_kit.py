'''Prompt kit — single source for executor system prompts + the budget/stance
paragraph.

Consolidates what the three executor adapters (claude_code read/write,
internal_llm, cli_tracking) used to triplicate:

- the shared prompt core: OpenSweep identity, investigation ethos,
  look-before-write discipline, durable-output rules (incl. the
  no-actionable-finding-is-valid rule), and the `complete_run` report contract
  (now with the covered_paths / skipped_paths / lens_verdicts coverage fields);
- per-kind deltas: write-mode hard rules (claude_code_write), the JSON
  envelope output contract (internal_llm / cli_tracking — wording preserved
  verbatim so envelope parsing behavior is unchanged), and the MCP startup
  note (claude_code kinds only);
- `stance_block()` — the single budget+stance paragraph that replaced both
  `_shared.budget_briefing` and `review_run_service.depth_block`.

Tool lists are GENERATED from the platform-tool registry
(`platform_tools.dispatcher.tool_descriptions`), so prompts can never drift
from the dispatch surface; the read/write grouping below is asserted against
the registry at import time.
