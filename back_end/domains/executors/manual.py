"""Manual executor adapter — humans post results via the HTTP transport.

`dispatch()` for `manual` is a no-op that immediately marks the Run as
`running`. The human then calls the platform tools directly (typically
the HTTP surface at `/api/v1/platform-tools/*`) and finishes by calling
`complete_run`.

This adapter exists primarily to land the platform tool surface end-to-end
without needing claude_code / internal_llm running.
