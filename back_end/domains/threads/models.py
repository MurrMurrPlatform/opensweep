"""Thread — one piece of work moving through the pipeline, with one
conversation attached (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-18-unified-dev-flow-design.md).

A Thread binds a ticket (or group parent) to a continuous refine → plan →
implement conversation. It orchestrates and references Runs; it never
replaces them. Review runs stay independent — their output attaches to the
timeline. Phase only ever moves through the service so every move is
legality-checked and audited.
