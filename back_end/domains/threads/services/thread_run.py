"""The `thread` playbook — ONE conversation, phase-gated by the platform
(unified dev flow rev2).

A thread run lives in a write sandbox (work branch created up front) for the
whole ticket lifecycle. The agent never pushes; the platform's write gate
decides what leaves the sandbox — so the phase gate is enforced HERE, not in
the prompt:

- refining      → finalize is a no-op (nothing the agent does goes anywhere)
- implementing / in_review
                → each completed turn reuses the implement finalize:
                  validate → push → adopt-or-open draft PR. Conversational
                  turns (no commits) stay quiet.

"Implement" is a platform-authored go-message into the SAME conversation
(send_message_turn), never a new run.
