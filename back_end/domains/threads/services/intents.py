"""First-turn prompts for thread sessions + implement carry-over addendum.

The session prompt reuses the read-only `refine` playbook but turns it into
plan mode: interrogate the user through the conversation, ground the ticket
in code, then persist the plan via the platform tools. Prompt-building is
pure so it stays testable without a DB (mirror: api/v1/tickets.py
