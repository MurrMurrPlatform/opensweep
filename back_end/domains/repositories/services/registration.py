"""Explicit GitHub repository registration (§7).

Repositories enter OpenSweep by SELECTION: the operator picks from the repos
their GitHub App installations grant access to (GET
/api/v1/github/app/available-repos → POST /api/v1/github/app/register-repo).
Installation webhooks only LINK/UNLINK installations onto repos that are
already registered — they never create Repository nodes.

This module owns the shared registration primitive plus the pure slug
helpers, so the endpoint (and any future flow) registers repos identically.
