"""trigger_run's dispatch launcher must not orphan the pipeline in a Celery
worker.

Regression for "campaign runs stuck QUEUED / preparing sandbox — cloning": a
worker-context dispatch used a fire-and-forget `asyncio.create_task`, which the
tick's short-lived `asyncio.run` loop cancelled mid-clone. The fix hands worker
dispatches off to the per-run `dispatch_run` Celery task (its own loop);
backend (long-lived ASGI loop) dispatches still run inline.
